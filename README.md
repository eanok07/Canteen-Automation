# canteen-automation
The Project “Canteen Automation System” enables the end users to register online, read and select the food from e-menu card and order food online by just selecting the food that the user want to have using web application. The results after selecting the food from the E-menu card will directly appear on the screen near the Chef who is going to cook the food for you. Canteen Management System is the system where customers order their food and receive food in the canteen without any delay as they can directly go and collect what they ordered without waiting for a turn or waiting time. This system aims to accelerate customer orders and customer order system used by employees to accept customer order. The purpose of the system is to develop a simple Canteen Management System and implement as a web-based application. The proposed “Canteen Automation System” is economically feasible because: The system requires very fewer time factors as compared to manual system. The system will provide fast and efficient automated environment instead of slow and error prone manual system, thus reducing both time and manpower spent in running the system. The system will have GUI interface and very less user training is required to learn it.
